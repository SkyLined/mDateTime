This repository contains Python, PHP and JavaScript classes that can be used to
handle dates and durations. The classes have been standardized so the way you
use them is similar of not exactly the same for all three languages. This makes
it easier to develop client/server software that uses all three languages as
you do not need to remember how to use the language specific features for
handling dates and durations in all three.
