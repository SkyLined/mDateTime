2019-07-30 - Removed license check
==================================
Use of this script does not require you to request a license from a license
server, hence the check to make sure you have a license has been removed.

2018-12-21 - Initial release
============================
This is the first public release of these scripts. They have been tested
sufficiently for me to use them in production servers and software myself but I
cannot guarantee they will function perfectly at all times.

I've only implemented those parts that I need at this time, e.g. there is no
code to handle time or timezones properly - just code to handle dates and
durations with a granularity of one day.
